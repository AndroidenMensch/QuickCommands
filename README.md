# Quick_Commands

Plugin for Unreal Engine 5 that adds a window what you can fill with console commands and you can execute them by clicking on them.

The window is resizable and dockable, the height of the cells is fixed, but you can scroll in the window if the cells don't fit.
The empty button is just an empty line in the file.
